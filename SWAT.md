## 2. Why We Are Doing This (Rationale)

### a. Business Justification:
- Recurring production outages, missed deadlines.
- Fast-growing product and platform scope require structure and process in swat.
- We need a **highly skilled, autonomous unit** that can engage, resolve, and hand over critical issues quickly.

### b. Strategic Alignment:
- Supports engineering excellence goals.
- Aligns with incident management, risk mitigation, and agile transformation.
- Enhances **resilience**, and **customer trust**.
- Creating a process and swat process daily tracking.

## 3. Why We Need a SWAT Team

- ‚ö° **Rapid Incident Response**: Handle high-priority production issues (P0/P1) quickly.
- üìö **Organizational Memory**: Document solutions and share learnings for future prevention.
-      Enhance **Customer trust** within ATB

## 5. Scope & Approach

### ‚úÖ IN SCOPE:
- Production P0/P1 incidents
- Complex cross-squad dependencies
- Journey wise health report.
- Journey wise proactive alerts.
- Journey wise SLA & Severity classification.
- Auto trouble shooting based on respective journey id(payment id, UM-ID, Change order ID) this can help new swat members to trouble shoot existing journies, mostly these will be async journey.
- Journey wise anomaly.
  1) Payment initiated and order created but events are missing. In these cases no  alerts will be generated.
  2) User created in downstream but not registered on ATB.
  3) Change order is in awaiting state for a long time. Waiting for some input.
     Need to explore if we can somehow automatically create a ticket in to downstream system with some severity.
- System Health Reporting based on Journey wise health, Weekly and Monthly Report.
- An TechOps Agent that understand nitty grity of individual journey and that can help in logical debugging.
  Example: Why payment is still in Pending state.
           Why User Request is still in pending state.
           Why Change order is not closed.
           Who can raise Sim Swap Request.
 For this We need to train AI Agenet on UP TO Date LLD for different journies.          
     

  

### üö´ OUT OF SCOPE:
- Routine feature development.
- Ownership of non-core services.
- Infra ownership on production.
- SIT Support.
- Production Infra Setup.

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric                        | Target                   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mean Time to Engage          | < 2 hours (critical issues) |
| Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)  | < 24‚Äì48 hours            |
| % Successful Transitions     | 100%                     |
